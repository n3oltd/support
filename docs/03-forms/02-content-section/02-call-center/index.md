The next document type to understand under **Content** in the section menu is **Call Center**. The call center functionality offers a seamless donor care solution, empowering charities to efficiently manage all aspects of your call campaigns. 

Similar to this extensive feature in Engage, you can also find it in **Engage Forms**. Engage forms allow you to:

1. Easily create **separate folders** for agents working in different time zones like UK, or Pakistan.
2. Create calling summaries **from and to** a certain time period.
3. Get free from the hassle to wait for **downloading** of huge calling lists.
4. Obtain the **calling list Excel sheet** as soon as downloading is completed in **seconds**.
5. Get notified via **email** about the completion of the export of a calling summary. 

## Create a Calling Summary              

The calling summary in Engage forms is basically a record of multiple statistics related to agents calling different donors via call center in Engage. These statistics include:

- Call begin and end at date + time
- Call reference
- Call duration
- Call status
- Income raised during the call, etc.

To create a calling summary:

**1.** Click Engage on the main dashboard and navigate to **Engage Forms**.
