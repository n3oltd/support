Another major part of **Engage Forms** under **Content** in the section menu is **Sponsorships**. The sponsorships module is custom-built to manage hundreds of thousands of donor-to-beneficiary relationships. It has two main parts; **Engage** and **Engage Forms**. Engage stores the relationship between the donor and beneficiary along with other functionalities such as payments and donations whereas Engage forms stores the actual data of the beneficiaries.

## Collect and Add Beneficiary Information in Engage Forms

Engage forms allow you to customize the data you want to collect about your beneficiaries (whether itâ€™s about their family, health, education, or hobby) and manage what it looks like. Each beneficiary when added in Engage forms, is automatically synced with Engage allowing the donor to view the relationship and conduct any actions necessary.

To add a new beneficiary:

**1.** Click Engage on the main dashboard and navigate to **Engage Forms**.
