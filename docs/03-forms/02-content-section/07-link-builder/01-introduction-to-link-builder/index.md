Similar to **Google Campaign URL Builder**, **Link Builder** is a tool that allows charities to create multiple custom URLs with or without UTM parameters for tracking donations coming from their websites into Engage. It helps them understand where the traffic is comes from, what specific donation campaigns drive engagement, and how users interact with their content.

## Why Use Link Builder?

- **Track Campaign Performance:** By generating custom URLs, you can track where traffic is coming from and see which campaigns, sources, or mediums are driving conversions.

- **Analyze Marketing Effectiveness in Google Analytics and Engage Simultaneously:** UTM-tagged URLs generated provide detailed insights in Google Analytics at the same time as Engage, allowing you to absorb the effectiveness of different campaigns, content types, or ad variations from both.

- **Improve Decision-Making:** With detailed tracking, you can make data-driven decisions, optimize campaigns, and allocate marketing budgets more effectively based on real user behavior.

## Key Elements of Link Builder

**1. Website URL:** The destination URL of the webpage where you want to send traffic (e.g., any page on your website).

**2. Engage URL:** The Engage URL which will send donation data to Engage and will attribute it towards the dimensions defined. 

**3. Campaign Source (utm_source):** Identifies the origin of the traffic (e.g., "google", "facebook"). This is essential for determining which platform or site is sending the user.

**4. Campaign Medium (utm_medium):** Describes the type of traffic (e.g., "email", "cpc" for cost-per-click, "social", "referral"). This helps identify how users are getting to your site.

**5. Campaign Name (utm_campaign):** Allows you to name the specific donation campaign (e.g., "gaza_appeal", "water_project"). It helps in tracking the success of individual campaigns.
