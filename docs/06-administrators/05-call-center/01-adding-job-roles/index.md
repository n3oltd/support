Job roles indicate the duty and responsibility of any agent in the call center. In Engage, admin users define multiple job roles that can further be chosen by the agents as soon as they sign in for their shift. 

You, as an admin user, can add a new job role or edit any previous one via the **pen icon**. Click on **Admin** in the header menu, **Call Center** and then **Job Roles** from the side menu. On the **Manage Job Roles** screen, click the **+ Add Job Role** option, **name** the job role and select **OK**. All job roles appear in the form of a list along with their names.
