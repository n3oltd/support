Cancellation reasons in general explain about the justifications provided for terminating or discontinuing a certain function. In Engage, admin users can add different cancellation reasons for multiple regular givings created.

To add a reason, click on **Admin** in the header menu, **Giving** and then **Cancellation Reasons** from the side menu. On the **Manage Giving Cancellation Reasons** screen, click **+ Add Giving Cancellation Reason**, input the name and select **OK**. You can also edit and delete any existing cancellation reason.
