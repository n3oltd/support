Touchpoints refer to any interaction that a customer has with a product, or service. These interactions can occur at various stages of the customer journey and across multiple channels. In Engage, admin users can manage multiple touchpoints that appear when a donor starts creating an individual or organizational account.   

:::info
Attribution dimensions that appear while creating a touchpoint are the same as those added in the Admin Attribution section.
:::

You can add a new touchpoint or edit any previous one via the **down arrow**. Click on **Admin** in the header menu, **Analytics** and then **Touchpoints** from the side menu. On the **Manage Touchpoints** screen, click the **+ Add Touchpoint** option, **name** it, choose the **lifetime** as number of hours, days, months, or year etc., input the **attribution dimensions** as required from the dropdown and select **Save**. 

All touchpoints added appear in the form of a list stating their:

1. Name
2. Lifetime
3. Attribution dimensions 
4. Status as *active* or *inactive*.
