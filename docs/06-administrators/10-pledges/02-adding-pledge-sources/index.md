In Engage, a pledge source indicates the origin of the pledge being created. This origin can be an internal one or any third party. A single pledge source may include multiple pledges created by the donors. Admin users can add pledge sources according to the usage of the organisation.

Click on **Admin** in the header menu, **Pledges** and then **Sources** from the side menu. To add a pledge source, click **Add Pledge Source**, input the name, choose the source as **Internal** or **3rd Party** and select **OK**. You can also edit and delete any existing pledge source.
