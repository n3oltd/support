In a CRM, payments are integral to an organization's financial operations, customer relations, and fundraising efforts. Payment types refer to the various ways that customers or donors can make payments to an organization. Engage supports different payment types including:

1. Credit/Debit Card Payments
2. Bank Transfers
3. Cheque/Cash Payments
4. Agency Payment Models
5. Direct Debit
6. Other Payment Types

Every time a payment is made towards a donation in Engage, it is saved and synced within **Tally**. Tally keeps a record of all these payments as financial transactions, where you can search each payment and view its details. Have a look at the next section to read more about searching payments.
