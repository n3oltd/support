Engage is a CRM built specifically for charities and nonprofit organizations (NGOs), designed to help manage donations, donor relationships, and streamline operations. With its rich feature set and intuitive design, Engage empowers organizations to optimize fundraising, enhance donor engagement, and operate with greater flexibility.

Here’s how your charity can make the most of the Engage CRM:

## 1. Managing Donor Data with Engage

- Centralizes donor information (phone numbers, emails, preferences) in one secure location.
- Facilitates quick and accurate Gift Aid claims with readily available donor details like name and postal address.
- Supports targeted outreach based on preferred contact methods (email or phone).
- Enables personalized engagement with high-value donors.
-  Eliminates the need to manage donor data across multiple tools, improving fundraising and reporting efficiency.

## 2. Utilizing Donor Database

- Import donor data from external platforms (e.g., LaunchGood) into Engage for a centralized view.
- Use this data for periodic targeted outreach like email or phone campaigns to increase donor retention and giving.
- Create segmented lists based on donor activity, campaign interest, or donation recency.

## 3. Using Data Lists for Targeted Actions

Engage's Lists feature allows charities to create dynamic and filtered lists for various use cases:

- Gift Aid claims
- High-value donors
- Donors from the last 1–2 years using date filters
- Donors who supported specific campaigns
- Create location-based lists to invite supporters to local events or region-specific initiatives

Also, lists are used to personalize interactions for special campaigns (e.g., mosque extension or community project) by:

- Sending a thank-you gift or hamper
- Issuing a personalized certificate
- Coordinating a call from a senior team member (CEO or Chair) to express gratitude

## 4. Financial Reconciliation Made Simple

Finance teams can begin monthly reconciliation 3–5 days before month-end by:

- Uploading external income data (crowdfunding, event donations).
- Matching this data with bank statements and payout reports (e.g., from Stripe).

Ensures real-time, accurate donation histories in Engage for:

- Reliable financial reporting
- Efficient Gift Aid processing
- Donor segmentation and reporting

## 5. Internal Workshop & CRM Setup Recommendations

For charities new to Engage:

- Start with an internal workshop to identify pain points in daily operations.
- Customize Engage workflows to address these challenges effectively.
- Nominate one or two CRM champions to receive in-depth training and lead internal support.
- Leverage N3O’s support team for guidance on setup, customization, and best practices.
