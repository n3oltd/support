Within the Umbraco backoffice, the core building blocks under *Content* that you need to study are:

1. **Home:** Contains all the content blocks and elements that need to be added or editied to be shown on the production website. 

2. **Giving:** Includes everything about donations and collecting donations through the website.

3. **Settings:** Contains information about the backend settings of the website. 

4. **Template:** Consists of the header and footer options for the website.

Each of these are explained in detail under their respective sections ahead.
