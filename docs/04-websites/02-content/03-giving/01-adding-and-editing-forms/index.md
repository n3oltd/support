As soon as all the donation items are added and configured in the Umbraco backoffice with the Engage CRM, the next step is use them to raise money for a dedicated cause. This is done via adding donation forms on the website.

A charity organisation may have separate donation forms to raise donation via the website as a whole or separate pages. Let's look at each of those forms in detail.

## Viewing the Donate Page for General Donations and Adding Funds

Every change made to the **Donate Page form** would automatically reflect on the production site.

The donate page is the actual checkout to donate generally via the website. Click the **Donate Now** button on the top right of the production site to view the page. 

To add a new fund to the existing donate page form, preconfigured by N3O:

**1.** Go to **Giving** and select **Forms**. A **Donate Page** item will appear.

**2.** Hover over Donate Page and click the **... dots**. 

**3.** Click **Fund** on the **Create** screen.

**4.** Input the **name** of the fund, add the donation item for which the fund would raise money, default **giving type**, each **fund dimension** (*location*, *theme* and *stipulation*) and **price handles** related to the giving type.

**5.** The fund added in the donation form can be viewed in the dropdown and price handles if added would show as defaults on the production site. *For example, a fund with donation item "Care for Disabled", and any price handles as providing "$50 to 1 child" or "$100 to 2 children" when added, will automatically reflect under the dropdown in the main donate page.*

## Viewing Donate Forms for a Single Page and Adding Funds

:::note
Every change done in the single page donate forms would automatically reflect on the production site.

You can also create separate donate forms for each page on the website. For example, the *Palestine Emergency page* can have a donation form to raise money for Palestine emergency only. To view and add funds to a form for a single page:

**1.** Go to **Giving** and select **Forms**. 

**2.** Hover over **Forms** and click the **... dots**. Select **Donation Form**.

**3.** **Name** the page and give the form a **Title**.

**7.** The fund added in the donation form can be viewed in the dropdown and price handles if added would show as defaults on the production site. *For example, a fund with donation item "Palestine Emergency", and any price handles when added, will automatically reflect under the dropdown in the main donate page.*
