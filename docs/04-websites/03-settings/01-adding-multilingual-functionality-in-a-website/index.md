**1.** Go to the **Settings** tab in the main menu.

**2.** Select **Languages** in the Settings tree. The **Languages** window opens in the editor. The default language **English** is already displayed where all the content was added.

## Adding Language Variants to the Content

For multilingual websites, you will find a language dropdown above your content tree. If it's not there, you might need to refresh the page:

To add language variants to the content, follow these steps:
