Layouts determine the arrangement and structure of partials created within the SMS content. 

To create a layout, click the **+ Create New Layout** option. On the **Create Layout** screen, in the upper section:

1. Input the **Name** of the layout.
2. Choose the **Template Models**, model type for which the email would be sent e.g. accounts or sponsorships. 

In the lower section:

1. Write down the content of the layout as *plain text* only. You can also preview the content via the **Preview** option.
2. Click the **+** icon and search for the available merge fields for the selected template model. By default, merge fields related to the template model selected appear automatically and are populated once the email is generated.
4. Add any extra notes and click **Save**.
