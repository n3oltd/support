2. Write the **Alias Name** that can be further used in layouts and templates. 
3. Choose the **Template Models**, model type for which the email would be sent e.g. accounts or sponsorships. 
4. Choose the **Stylesheets**, *CSS* files used to define the visual presentation and layout of elements within a document.

In the lower section:

1. Write down the content of the partial as *plain text* or *HTML*. You can also preview the content via the **Preview** option.
