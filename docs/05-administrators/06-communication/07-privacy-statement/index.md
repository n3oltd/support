Privacy statement is a document that outlines how an organization collects, uses, discloses, and manages the personal information of individuals. In Engage, admin users only can add, manage and edit privacy statements.

Click **+ Add Privacy Statement**, input a **unique identifier**, write down the body of the statement as **HTML markup**, tickmark the statement as *default* or not and click **OK**.

All privacy statements appear in the form of a list with parameters **identifier** and **status** as *active* or *inactive*. You can do many actions with a single privacy statement:

- View the statement with the *eye icon*.
- Delete it, if required.
- Mark any one of it as *default*.
