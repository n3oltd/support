Skip reasons indicate specific reasons for which a call might be skipped or not handled by the agent or system. In Engage, if an agent wants to skip the account called, they need to select a reason. For this purpose, admin users including call center managers manage the skip reasons by adding them in the system.

You, as an admin user, can add or edit any existing skip reason. Click the **+ Add Skip Reason** option, **name** the reason, add any **description** and select **OK**. All skip reasons appear in the form of a list along with their names.
