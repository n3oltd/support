Call purposes in a call center refers to the reason or objective for which an agent initiates a phone call towards a donor. In Engage, these reasons appear the moment a call is ended. Some of these reasons are set as default by the system itself e.g. *concluded*, *no answer*, etc.

Admin users including call center managers have the priviledge to add a new call reason or edit any existing one in Engage. Click on **Admin** in the header menu, **Call Center** and then **Call Purposes** from the side menu. On the **Manage Call Purpose** screen, click the **+ Add Call Purpose** option, **name** the purpose, add any **description** and select **OK**. All call purposes appear in the form of a list along with their names.
