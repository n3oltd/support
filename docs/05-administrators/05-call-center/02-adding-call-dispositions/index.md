Call disposition is basically the outcome or result of a customer interaction or call in a call center. In Engage, each call when ended by an agent has different call dispositions to choose from. Admin users, mainly the call center managers, manage the call disposition reasons for the call center. 

You, as an admin user or call center manager, can add a new disposition or edit any previous one via the **pen icon**. Click on **Admin** in the header menu, **Call Center** and then **Call Dispositions** from the side menu. On the **Manage Call Dispositions** screen, click the **+ Add Call Disposition** option, **name** the disposition and select **OK**. All call dispositions appear in the form of a list along with their names.
