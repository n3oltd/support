In Engage, sponsorship ended reasons explain why a particular sponsorship between a sponsor and a beneficiary ended. Admin users can add any ended reason according to the users preference. 

To add an ended reason, click **Add Sponsorship Ended Reason**, input the name, and select **OK**. You can also edit and delete any existing ended reason.
