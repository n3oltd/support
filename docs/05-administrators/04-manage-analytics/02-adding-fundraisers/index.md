Fundraiser is an event or campaign whose purpose is to raise money for a cause, charity or non-profit organization. Admin users manage fundraisers that appear when a donor wants to add them while making a certain donation in Engage.

You can add a new fundraiser or edit any previous ones via the **down arrow**. Click the **+ Add Fundraiser** option, **name** it and select **Save**. All fundraisers added appear in the form of a list along with their names and status. Each fundraiser starts with an *active* status, but you can also deactivate it, if required.
