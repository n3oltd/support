In Engage, campaigns are useful when an organization wants to associate particular donation items or projects to a dedicated time period. Admin users can add multiple campaigns and save them.

To add a campaign, click on **Admin** in the header menu, **Analytics** and then **Campaigns** from the side menu. On the **Manage Campaigns** screen, click **+ Add Campaign** and:

1. Input the **name** of the campaign.
2. **From** and **To** dates of the campaign.
3. Add **rule sets** in the **Allocation Matching Rules** to decide how to attribute income to campaigns. Income that matches any of these rule sets will be attributed to this campaign. You can add multiple rule sets as well.

All campaigns added appear in the form of a list including the following parameters. You can edit and delete any existing campaign as well.

1. Name
2. Dates
3. Allocations
