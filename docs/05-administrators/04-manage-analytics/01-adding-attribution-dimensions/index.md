Attribution dimensions indicate the various factors or criteria used to attribute something, such as revenue, to specific sources or elements within a system. This concept is commonly applied in marketing, analytics, and other areas where understanding the contribution of different factors is essential. 

Admin users manage attribution dimensions that appear when a donor wants to add attributions to a certain donation in Engage. They can be added in different contexts e.g. marketing attribution dimensions including channel, campaign or source, etc. 

:::warning
Each dimension for the first time appears with a warning:

**This attribution dimension is inactive and cannot be used to attribute funds. If you want to use this attribution dimension, ensure options have been added and then activate it from the Options menu.**
:::

You can add a new dimension and also edit, change its order, deactivate or activate any previously added dimensions via the **down arrow**. To add, click the down arrow and select **Edit**. Change the dimension name, if required, add the options in a comma separated manner and click **Save**.
