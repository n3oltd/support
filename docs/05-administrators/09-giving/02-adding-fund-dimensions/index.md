Fund dimensions indicate the way to manage funds or donations based on pre-defined dimension criteria within a CRM. In Engage, admin users must first add fund dimensions in order to create donations via funds, pledges, single or regular donations.

:::warning
Each fund dimension is inactive at first and cannot be used to allocate funds. If you want to use a fund dimension, ensure restricted options have been added and activated from the **Options** menu.
:::

Click on **Admin** in the header menu, **Giving** and then **Fund Dimensions** from the side menu. To add a new fund dimension, click the **down arrow** on a dimension block and choose **Edit**. 

1. **Name** the dimension.
2. Add different options to assign funds for specific purposes in the **Restricted to** section.
3. Tickmark the **Enable Unrestricted Option** and add a general option for funds that are not restricted to any of the options in the **Restricted** section. 
4. Click **Save**.

As soon as the fund dimension is saved, click the down arrow and select **Activate**, to activate it. You can also edit any previously added fund dimension, if required.
