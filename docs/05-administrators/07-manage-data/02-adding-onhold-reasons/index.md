In Engage, on hold reasons indicate the reasons for which an *Import Record* may be placed **on hold** or **wait** status by a user of the system. 

You can add and also edit any previously added on hold reason via the **pen icon**. Click on **Admin** in the header menu, **Data** and then **On Hold Reasons** from the side menu. On the **Manage Record On Hold Reasons** screen, click the **+ Add On Hold Reason** option, **name** the reason and select **OK**. All on hold reasons appear in the form of a list along with their names.
