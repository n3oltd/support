Some common field types added for custom forms in Engage are:

- **Text field:** For inputs such as name, description, email address, phone number, etc.
- **Dropdown list:** To choose a value from a predefined list of options like country, or state. 
- **Lookup field:** To search and select from a list of existing records within the CRM.

**8.** When a form with all its required fields is complete, it will automatically appear under the type selected at the beginning. For e.g. if form type **Account** is chosen, then it will show while creating a new account and on all the account profiles main page.
