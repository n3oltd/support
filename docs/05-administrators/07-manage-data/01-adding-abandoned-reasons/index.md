In Engage, abandoned reasons indicate the reasons for which a user of the system may choose to abandon an *Import Record* instead of importing it. 

You can add and also edit any previously added abandoned reason via the **pen icon**. To add, click the **+ Add Abandoned Reason** option, **name** the reason and select **OK**. All abandoned reasons appear in the form of a list along with their names.
