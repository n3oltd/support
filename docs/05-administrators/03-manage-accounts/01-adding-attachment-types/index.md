Attachments refer to any digital file, such as a document, image etc. that is added or included along with a donation or funding submission to a charity organization. Admin users can manage attachment types that appear as a part of the dropdown while adding them under an accounts profile menu. 

You can add and also edit any previously added attachments via the **pen icon**. Click on **Admin** in the header menu, **Accounts** and then **Attachment Types** from the side menu. On the **Manage Accounts** screen, click the **+ Add Attachment Type** option, **name** the attachment and select **OK**. All attachments appear in the form of a list along with their names.
