A pledge is a formal promise or commitment made by an individual or organization to contribute a specified amount of money in support of a cause or charity.

## How to Create a Pledge in Engage?

1. In the *information* section, select the **Date**. By default, current date is displayed.

2. **Name** the pledge whatever you want and choose the **Source**, whether *internal* or *3rd Party*. 

:::note
Internal sources are managed by your system administrator.
:::

3. Choose **Enable Allocations** as yes or no. If yes, then an *Allocations* section appears, where you can allocate funds, existing sponsorships, or feedbacks to the pledge. You can also add extra amount in *Allocate Later* text box and the total amount will be shown at the bottom right. 

:::tip
Allocations can be enabled even after a pledge's creation. Click the **three dots(...)** while viewing a pledge and select *Add Allocations*. An Allocations section will appear under the information section of the pledge.
