Payments within a CRM are integral to an organization's financial operations, customer relations, and fundraising efforts. They refer to the various ways that customers or donors can make payments to an organization. **Engage** supports different payment types including:

1. Credit/Debit Card Payments
2. Bank Transfers
3. Check/Cash Payments
4. Agency Payment Models 
5. Direct Debit

Each payment type has different payment methods that can be added by your system administrator for you. Each payment method can be added, activated or deactivated, having different fields to be filled up, according to use.

Payment methods must be configured by your system administrator before making a donation.

## Adding Payment Methods While Making Donations

Single donations include all the payment types, but regular donations include *card* and *direct debit* only.

While making single or regular donations, there is a separate *Payment* section at the end.

### Single donations
