Failed payments refer to payment transactions that were attempted but did not successfully process. These can occur for various reasons and are crucial to monitor and manage for businesses or nonprofit organizations. Common reasons can be:

1. **Insufficient Funds:** The most common reason for a payment failure is insufficient funds in the payer's bank account or on their credit/debit card.

2. **Expired or Invalid Payment Method:** Credit cards or bank accounts can expire or become invalid. When customers attempt to pay with such methods, the transaction fails.

3. **Payment Declined by Bank:** The payer's bank may decline the transaction due to various reasons, including security concerns or unusual activity.

4. **Technical Issues:** Technical problems on the payment gateway or CRM system can lead to payment failures.
