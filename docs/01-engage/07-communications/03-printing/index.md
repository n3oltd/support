Printing batches is a process of generating and printing multiple documents in a single batch, rather than printing each document individually. This is important in terms of: 

- **Time and Resource Efficiency:** Printing batches save time and effort by allowing multiple documents to be printed simultaneously.

- **Bulk Processing:** Printing batches enables bulk processing of documents, making it easier to manage and distribute information in printed form.

- **Reduced Errors:** Printing batches help reduce the risk of errors that may occur when manually printing individual documents one by one.
