:::info
The **caller option** is shown to a *call center manager* and *team lead* **only**, not a simple agent or team member. Simple agent only has a list of his or her own calls that have been made. Manager has a list of all callers and campaigns and team lead only has a list of himself and all agents present in his/her team.
