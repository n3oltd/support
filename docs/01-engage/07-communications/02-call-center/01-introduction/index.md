Call center is a centralized facility within an organization that is dedicated to handling inbound and outbound communications with donors. It is designed to manage a large volume of communications efficiently and provide high-quality customer service and support.

## Purpose of Call Center in Engage

Engage provides a **call center** module that plays a pivotal role in facilitating verbal correspondence via teams and campaigns. This specifically helps to maintain a strong relationship with donors in far areas where there is no proper internet or with donors who feel more comfortable in donating or performing other activities via verbal correspondence. Examples include calling donors with existing sponsorships, having failed payments in relation to donations or adding new donors.

Call center consists of:
 
**1.** Making calls to various donors for multiple purposes.

**2.** Scheduling appointments with donors if they are not available for immediate calls.

**3.** Creating and managing teams and campaigns.
