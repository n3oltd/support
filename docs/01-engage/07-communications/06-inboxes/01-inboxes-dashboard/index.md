In Engage, an inbox is used for **reviewing** multiple **feedback and sponsorship reports** in one place. It's functionality is similar to and synced with the <K2Link route="docs/forms/content-section/reports/" text="Reports section" isInternal/> under **Engage Forms**. 

Reports created in Umbraco (Engage Forms) for any beneficiary sponsored or feedback created, automatically appear under the **Inboxes dashboard** in Engage. Hence, donors can review awaiting reports directly within Engage as well. Similarly, with a single report, you can:

- Either **review** the report and **reject** it for any reason.
- Or **review** the report, change the report **due date**, if needed, and **approve** it accordingly.

:::tip
To utilize the inbox functionality, feedback and sponsorship schemes must be created beforehand.
