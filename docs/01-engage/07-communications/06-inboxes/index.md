The **Inboxes** feature in a CRM serves as a centralized communication hub that consolidates all donor reports including feedback and sponsorship reports into one place. It allows teams within a charity to manage and track these communications across multiple accounts in the CRM. 

By organizing communication within the CRM, charities can ensure that no customer inquiry is missed, while maintaining a clear history of all interactions for improved customer service and follow-up. Inboxes streamline the workflow by tracking responses, and fostering collaboration across departments, leading to more efficient and personalized donor engagement.
