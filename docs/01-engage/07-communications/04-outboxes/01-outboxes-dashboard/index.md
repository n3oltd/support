In Engage, an outbox is used for sending ad-hoc correspondence (email, SMS, or document) to an account for e.g., a payment delivery is failed, or a sponsorship is due for renewal. These correspondences can be sent via two ways:

1. To one account at a time manually
2. To different accounts automatically for a similar purpose in bulk via lists

:::note
To add outboxes and its functionality, as your system administrator to that for you.

You can view all existing outboxes in the outboxes dashboard screen representing different departments for e.g. all emails, documents or SMS related to sponsorships will be handled under the *Sponsorship Outbox*.

1. Click *Communications* in the top menu bar and then *Outboxes* in the quick navigation section to view the *Outboxes* screen.

2. Each outbox includes two sections, *Templates* and *Sent Items*. Templates include all documents in the form of a list with parameters defined below. Sent items includes the time period of when the documents were sent to respective accounts e.g. *last 7 days*, *last 30 days* and *all time*. These documents are displayed in the form of a list.

You can use the *toggle button* on the right-hand to switch between different templates.
