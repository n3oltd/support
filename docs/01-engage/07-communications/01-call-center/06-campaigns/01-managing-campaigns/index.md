In a call center, campaigns refer to targeted initiatives or projects designed to achieve buisness goals through outbound calling or other communication methods. Certain key aspects of campaigns include:

- **Campaign Objectives:** Each campaign has a clear and well-defined objective. For example, an earthquake energency appeal campaign may aim to raise donations for a sudden earthquake.

- **Target Audience:** Call center campaigns target specific groups of individuals based on demographics, behavior, or other criteria relevant to the campaign's purpose. For example, a customer feedback survey campaign may target recent customers to gather their opinions and experiences.

In Engage, agents, grouped together in teams, can work under various campaigns.
