:::note Important
Each template sent will go through the 3 steps defined above, but an extra step will be involved depending on the template type. For example, template type 'Sponsorships', 'Donation' or 'Feedback' will ask to choose any donation made, sponsorship or feedback created related to the recipient account as an additional step.
