Engage allows moving a certain feedback under a scheme from one donor to another. This can happen due to any reason e.g. availability of the donor or other circumstances.

To move a feedback, follow the steps defined.

1. <K2Link route="" text="Search for a feedback" isInternal/> and view a list of all existing feedbacks or <K2Link route="docs/engage/accounts/searching-accounts/" text="search for the account" isInternal/> that created a particular feedback and go to the Feedbacks page.
