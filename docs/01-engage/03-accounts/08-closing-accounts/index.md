Deleting an account in Engage is quite quick and simple. But you can always come back to create an account again. 

**1.** In the <K2Link route="dashboard" text="Engage dashboard" isEngage />, click the **quick search box** in the header or use the **advanced search option** and search for the account you wish to delete.
