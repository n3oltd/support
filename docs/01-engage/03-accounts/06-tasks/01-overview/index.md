In a CRM, **tasks** refer to specific activities, actions, or assignments that need to be completed by individuals or organizations. These tasks are typically associated with managing interactions with donors, or leads, and they play a crucial role in facilitating efficient and organized customer relationship management.

Similarly, in **Engage**, tasks can be created and updated for systematic customer interactions.

## Why is Defining a Task Considered Important?

- **Task Management:** CRM software allows users to create, assign, and track tasks related to donor interactions, campaigns, and other essential charity funding activities. Tasks serve as a to-do list, ensuring that crucial actions are not overlooked or forgotten.

- **Customer Engagement:** Tasks enable proactive customer engagement. For example, customer service representatives can create tasks to address customer inquiries, resolve issues, or follow up on customer feedback.

- **Time Management:** Tasks help to prioritize activities and manage time effectively. By organizing tasks based on priority and deadlines, individuals can focus on critical activities and improve productivity.

- **Follow-Up and Reminders:** Tasks enable timely follow-up with customers and prospects, helping to maintain communication and build stronger relationships. Reminders can be set to ensure that important deadlines, meetings, or actions are not missed.

- **Collaboration and Communication:** Tasks in CRM software can be assigned to individuals or teams, promoting collaboration and accountability. Team members can leave comments, share updates, and collaborate on tasks, fostering better communication within the organization.
