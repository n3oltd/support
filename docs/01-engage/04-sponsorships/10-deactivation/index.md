Sponsorship deactivation typically refers to the process of discontinuing or ending a sponsorship arrangement between an individual/organization and a beneficiary. This is primarily used when the organization wants to remove the beneficiary entirely from the pool of available beneficiaries.

Engage allows you to deactivate a sponsorship for any beneficiary through **Engage Forms**, specifically designed for users to create and manage forms on the website. When deactivated, a beneficiary will not be able to be published or sponsored. This is different from unpublishing a beneficiary which means they are temporarily unavailable, but can be published by the organization relatively easily for re-sponsoring.

:::note
For any changes saved and published in Engage Forms, Engage automatically syncs and pulls the updated information.

## Steps to Deactivate Sponsorship

1. Login to *N3O Cloud Engage CRM* and open *Forms* by clicking on Engage in the top left corner.

2. In the Content tab, click on **Sponsorships**. On the right-hand side, different sponsorship programs which already exist in the system and are published, containing name and status, will appear in the form of a list.

You can also add a new sponsorship program with the **Create** button under different categories.

5. Now, under each scheme, select any country and a beneficiary list (list of orphans in this case) will appear which includes *name, status* and *reference* of each orphan.

6. Choose any orphan and view its complete profile under the **Profile** tab. 

7. In the **Deactivate** tab, choose the reason, add any extra notes, click *Save and publish* and send a deactivate request for the selected orphan.

## Approving Deactivations 

As a default, following the above process will not complete the deactivation process. Instead, beneficiaries submitted for deactivation will be sent to a queue to be approved by the head office.  

To access this queue and approve the deactivation, please see the following steps:

1. Under the **Sponsorships** Content tab, select any *program* and then *scheme*, e.g. *UK - Care Compass Production*.

2. In the top right corner, click **Dashboard** and then the **Deactivations** tab.

3. You will see a list of all the beneficiaries submitted for deactivation. Click the *down arrow* under the *Action* tab and select *Approve* for any beneficiary.

4. A prompt to approve as *yes* or *no* will appear. Select yes, and the request will be approved.
