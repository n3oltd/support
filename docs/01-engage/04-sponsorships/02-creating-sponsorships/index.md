In Engage, an account (donor or sponsor), whether individual or organization, can create a sponsorship to sponsor a beneficiary in support of any cause. This page will walk you through the steps to create a new sponsorship.

:::note
- By default a sponsorship is created as anonymous. To associate the sponsorship with an account, click *Change Account* and choose the account accordingly.
- Before creating a sponsorship, ask your system administrator to add sponsorship schemes for you.
- To avoid any duplicate sponsorships and their problems, first <K2Link route="" text="search for a sponsorship within Engage" isInternal/>.

You can also generate the "profile PDF" for the beneficiary for the first time via *Regenerate Profile PDF*. As soon as the PDF is generated, an option *Download Profile PDF* is displayed to download it if necessary. You can also view all reports related to the beneficiary e.g. annual reports via *View All Reports*.
