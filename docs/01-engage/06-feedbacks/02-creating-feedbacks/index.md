In Engage, an account, whether individual or organization, can create a feedback to donate towards specific projects. This page will walk you through the steps to create a new feedback.

:::note
- By default a feedback is created as anonymous. To associate a feedback with an account, click *Change Account* and choose the account accordingly.
- Before creating a feedback, ask your system administrator to add feedback schemes for you.
- To avoid any duplicate feedbacks and their problems, first <K2Link route="" text="search for a feedback" isInternal/> within Engage.

## Create a New Feedback

1. On the <K2Link route="feedbacks" text="Feedbacks dashboard" isEngage />, navigate to **quick navigation**. Click on **Create Feedback** and a screen will appear to create the feedback.

4. Specify the price to donate. Some feedback schemes have a fixed price as added by the system administrator therefore, it will be mandatory to donate that amount. 

5. Lastly, click **Create** if you only need to save the feedback or **Create & Donate** if you need to create the feedback and immediately donate towards it. The donation can be made as single or regular donation.
