In Engage, an account can create multiple feedbacks. This section will walk you through the steps to create a feedback from scratch.

:::note
- By default a feedback is created as anonymous. To associate a feedback with an account, click **Change Account** and choose the account accordingly.
- Before creating a feedback, ask your system administrator to add **feedback schemes** for you.
- To avoid any duplicate feedbacks and their problems, first <K2Link route="" text="search for a feedback" isInternal/> and then start creating it.

## Create a New Feedback

**1.** On the <K2Link route="feedbacks" text="Feedbacks dashboard" isEngage />, navigate to **quick navigation**. Click on **Create Feedback** and a screen will appear to create the feedback.

**2.** On the **Create Feedback** screen, choose any **scheme** from the drop-down and select the **currency**. By default the currency is set to GBP.

**4.** Specify the price to donate. Some feedback schemes have a fixed price as added by the system administrator therefore, it will be mandatory to donate that amount. 

**5.** Lastly, click **Create** if you only need to create and save the feedback or **Create & Donate** if you need to create the feedback and immediately donate towards it. The donation can be made as single donation or regular giving.
