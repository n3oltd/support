Attributions in a CRM refer to the process of assigning specific actions, interactions, or contributions to the appropriate sources, campaigns, or touchpoints. They are crucial for understanding the customer's journey and evaluating the effectiveness of marketing initiatives.

## Attribution Models

Attribution models in marketing refer to the methods used to allocate credit to various marketing touchpoints or channels for driving conversions or sales. This helps marketers understand the impact and effectiveness of each marketing touchpoint in the customer journey. There are several types of attribution models e.g. **Last-Click Attribution**, **First-Click Attribution** etc. 

Engage follows the **Linear Attribution Model** that assigns equal credit to each marketing touchpoint throughout the customer journey. It assumes that all touchpoints are equally important in contributing to the conversion.

For example, the attributions dedicated to a certain touchpoint could be:

- **Department** 
    - Technology: 50 pounds

- **Online Channels** 
    - Paid Ads: 25 pounds 
    - Google Search: 25 pounds

- **Platform**
    - Google Ads: 50 pounds

## Adding Attribution Dimensions in Engage

:::note
Attribution dimensions are added and managed by your system administrator.
:::

Attribution dimensions refer to the different elements that are considered when attributing a particular action or outcome to its respective channel, or touchpoint in a customer's journey. Common attribution dimensions include:

- Channel
- Campaign
- Time
- Location

:::caution
An attribution dimension remains *inactive* and cannot be used to attribute funds until options have been added and activated from the option's menu. 
:::

In Engage, before adding a touchpoint, ask your system administrator to add attribute dimensions for you. Attribute dimensions may include *channel, campaign* etc. and can be activated or deactivated according to their usage. 

Also, while making a single or regular giving donation, attributions can be added manually after adding funds, pledges etc. in the *Allocations* section.

:::note
You can add attributions manually for a donation or set back to automatic attributions. Also, each attribution can be updated as well after its addition. 
:::

1. Click **Add Attributions Manually** after allocating funds in the *Allocations* section.

2. Click the down arrow in the *Attributions* section and select **Add Attributions**.

3. A pop-up screen **Add Attributions** appears where you can select the attribute dimension and any of its options which were added by your system administrator. You can add more than one option and the amount allocated for donation will split in an equal percentage for each option. For e.g. attribution dimension "channel" having options "online", "post", "telephone" etc. split the amount "$1000" in an equal "33.34%" i.e. "$333.3" for each option.
