2. Search for an account on the left-hand side. This will take you to the account's *Enter Donation* screen. 

3. Choose the type of donation, in this case, *Regular Giving Donation*.

4. In the **Allocations** section, specify where you want to make a donation, for example, towards a fund or a certain pledge. As a result, you will refer to the exact program or scheme where you want your donation to be allocated to. 

:::note Important
- If you want to switch from regular to single donation, then allocations already allocated to one donation type will not be transferable to the other.
- You can define more than one allocation for a regular giving donation.
- Each sum of donated money from a regular giving allocation will be totaled and shown as **Total Amount.**  
- You need to complete the allocation's section before proceeding to payment.
