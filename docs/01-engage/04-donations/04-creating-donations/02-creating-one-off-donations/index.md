4. In the **Allocations** section, you can specify where you want to make a donation for e.g. to an existing beneficiary. As a result, you will refer to the exact program or scheme where you want your donation to be allocated to. 

:::note Important
- If you want to switch from single to regular donation, then allocations already allocated to one donation type will not be transferable to the other.
- You can define more than one allocation for a single donation.
- Each sum of donated money from a single allocation will be totaled and shown as **Total Amount.**  
- You need to complete the allocation's section before proceeding to payment.
