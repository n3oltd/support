**2.** Search for an account on the left-hand side. This will take you to the account's *Enter Donation* screen. 

**3.** Choose the type of donation, i.e., *Scheduled Giving*.

:::note
You can choose the **currency** you wish to donate in for e.g. *GBP or EUR* on the top right, but the default is set to **GBP**.
:::

**4.** In the **Allocations** section, specify the allocation towards which you will be donating, e.g., a **fund, pledge, sponsorship**, or **feedback**. By default, a fund is shown. Also, choose a **fundraiser**, if required.

:::note Important
- If you want to switch from scheduled giving to other donation type, then allocations already allocated to previous donation type will not be transferable to the next.
- You can define more than one allocation for a single scheduled giving.
- Each sum of donated money from a regular giving allocation will be totaled and shown as **Total Amount.**  
- You must complete the **Scheduled Giving** section before proceeding to payment.

Look at the table below for the different defined allocations which you can make.

| Allocation Types | Functionality |
| ---------------- | ------------- |
| **Fund** | Funds in Engage are called <K2Link route="docs/engage/donations/allocations/donation-items/" text="donation items" isInternal />. You can select any donation item, a *program, event or campaign*, and its fund dimensions including *location, theme* etc. to donate towards it. |
| **Pledge** | To add an allocation as a pledge, select the "Pledge" option which opens a **Search Pledges** pop-up screen. Filter and specify the required parameters to search a pledge or choose any existing one from the list. Pledges containing one or more allocations unavailable to any type of giving will appear blur. Once a pledge is choosen, it appears as **'Towards Pledge - reference number'** in the allocations section. |
| **Sponsorship** | To add an allocation as a sponsorship, click the **down arrow** to either create a **new** sponsorship or donate to an **existing** one. |
| **Feedback** | To add an allocation as a sponsorship, click the **down arrow** to either create a **new** feedback or donate to an **existing** one.|

:::info

**5.** Moving onto the **Scheduled Giving** section; 

- Select the **campaign (towards which the donation would be scheduled for)**, **timezone**, **start date (date on which the scheduled donation would start)** and **split process** as saved for the campaign.

- Tickmark **Enable installment actions** if you want to generate a correspondence such as a receipt each time a donation is collected.
