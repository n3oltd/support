In Engage, an account can search for all types of payments made while making single or regular giving donations via the **advanced search** option. 

The advanced search function is a detailed search option which gives you the leverage to search for any specific type of payment. You can search for payments that are completed, failed to process or canceled. The advanced search screen is made up of a **Filters** panel on the left which you can collapse, and a **results** panel on the right.

1. On the <K2Link route="dashboard" text="Engage dashboard" isEngage />, click the **Search** button next to **Create**. Choose the type of search you wish to perform, in this case, **Payments**.
