In Engage, payments are added while making a single donation or regular giving. As soon as an amount for a donation is allocated, there comes a separate **Payment** section to complete the donation.

:::tip
Single donations include all the payment types, but regular donations include **card** and **direct debit** only.
:::

## Single or Anonymous Donations

**1.** Select any payment type. Each payment type has its own required fields to fill in with **Payment date** being a similar field. Let us choose **Agency Income**.

**2.** Select the **Payment Service Provider**. This includes all the payment methods that the system administrator has added for you.

**3.** Input the required fields. For e.g. agency income **Givebrite** has **Givebrite Charge ID**, **Receipt Book Number** and **Received by** fields. 

**4.** Each payment can be made in **full amount** or **other amount**, if needed.
