- All existing regular giving donations and pledges in a separate section.
- All existing donations in the form of a list in a separate section.

Each regular giving shows its **status**, **amount**, **reference number**, **date of previous and next donation**, and **payment method** opted. Click the **pen icon** and navigate to the detailed regular giving screen to edit and update any information.
