5. Click **Add Field** to add different fields to the list which represents the actual data you wish to see on the list. For e.g. in an **accounts** list, you need to add some major fields; **reference**, **display name**, **primary telephone number** and **current preference**. Some fields require additional data to be added e.g. current preference requires choosing the **field channel + category** and giving the **consent** whether to contact the account as *yes*, *no* or *any*.      

:::info
- Each field set has a number of other parameters which can be displayed as per necessary e.g. **address** or **postal code**. You may need not add and display each of them separately in a list.
- Each field can be edited again via the **settings icon**.
- Fields once added can be removed from the field set via the **"x"** icon.
- While adding fields, **results** start appearing on the right automatically for each field set.

6. Click **Add Filter Set** and then **Add Filter** to add filters to the selected fields of the list, narrowing down the results appearing on the right. E.g. in an accounts list, you can add a filter on **current preference** and select the **filter criteria** as **opt-in**. Accounts who have opted in for the choosen preference will be displayed only. 

:::note
It is not necessary to add filters for a field. You can always create a list **without** a filter set.
