Collecting, managing and importing data from different sources is crucial for a charity's operations. In particular regarding fundraising, this function can be used for importing account information, donations, and a number of other data-types.

But **Engage's Data Import** feature makes import easier than ever. Engage has been designed to ingest arbitrary data through a variety of mediums; **CSV/Excel sheets**, **webhooks** and **datafiles** in order to map them arbitrarily to columns. Hence, allowing users to import data from crowdfunding sites or 3rd party platforms, e.g. Justgiving or LaunchGood, bank transfers, donor information collected at events or an organization's website.

In this **Imports** section, you will find information on topics including:

1. Engage's queue dashboard that contains all created queues.
2. How to create a queue and view its detailed information.
3. How to import data within a queue via data feeds.
4. Advanced data import feature named "Field Transform".
5. What are data converters and how to use them in Engage Forms.
