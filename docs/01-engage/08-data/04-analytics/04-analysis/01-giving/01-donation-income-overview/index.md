## Understand Pivot Tables in the Donation Income Overview Report

Multiple pivot tables depicting donations processed according to their data are displayed in a single donation income overview report. Each tab shows a table with the **total number** and **total percentage of donation income** opposite to the types selected while setting up the report criteria and can be viewed by clicking on the respective tab button. For example, *"By Attribtuion" tab includes a data table providing the "total number" and "percentage of donations" in pounds opposite to the attribution dimension types selected*.

Let us have a look at some of the important pivot tables in the report.

### Overview

The **overview** tab displays the **total number** and **total percentage of donation income** under separate tables named **Income by Type** and **Income by Allocation**. Donation income is shown for all types of income and allocations selected while setting the report criteria.

### Data

The **data** tab displays each and every donation processed along with its detailed information including:

- Donation details like **donation reference**, **donation date** and **donation time**. 
- **Amount** allocated to the donation separately according to the **attribution dimensions** specified. *For example, a single donation that allocated "two" 50 pounds to online and post attribution dimensions, shows itself as two separate donations processed under the data tab*.
- **Payment methods** used.
- All the rest of the figures that were preselected while setting the report criteria like **allocation type**, **donation item**, **fund dimensions** or **account type**.
