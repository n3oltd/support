Reporting periods in a CRM are specific time frames used to collect and analyze data for reporting purposes. These periods help asses performance and track progress for multiple features displayed within a report.

In Engage, you can manage and add different reporting periods that are saved and displayed under the **Reporting Period filter** such as:

1. Yesterday
2. Last Week
3. Last Month
4. Over a Year

Each of these periods can be selected to display the required report information under the reports **Executive Summary** section.
