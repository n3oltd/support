Engage provides a feature to create **bookmarked reports** of any tab within a particular report. Bookmarks allow you to keep track of what's important to you by capturing the state of a report including any filters or extra visuals added. You can easily view your bookmarked report at any time.

## Create a First Bookmark

To create a bookmark for the first time, open up the **Bookmarks** panel on the left-hand side of a report and click **Capture New Bookmark**. Name the bookmark and the current report view will be saved in the bookmarks section. A bookmark can be saved for any report and its pages, for example, **giving income overview** report and its pages **income overview**, **income by donation item** and **income by funds**.

A newly created bookmark saves the following elements:

1. The current report page
2. Any filters defined whether on visuals or the whole report
3. Any visuals added or deleted 
4. Information changes due to additions or updates in the CRM (Engage)
