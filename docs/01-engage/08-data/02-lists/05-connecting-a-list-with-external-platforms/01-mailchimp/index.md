A list created in Engage can be connected with multiple external email marketing platforms. This can be handy for sending bespoke thankyou or other emails to donors for their donations or extra efforts. In this guide, you will learn how to connect your list with **Mailchimp**.

## Create an Audience and API Key in Mailchimp

Login to your Mailchimp account and first set up an **audience**. Your audience is where you will store and manage all your contacts/donors data. If you have existing one, you can also use that but for now let's create a new one. 

**1.** Click **Audience**, then click **Audience dashboard** in the sidebar menu.

**2.** Click the **Manage Audience** drop-down and choose **View audiences**.

**4.** Enter the details in the fields provided like **audience name**, **default name**, **email address** and **campaign URL settings** according to your organization.

**5.** Review the **Contact information** for this audience, and edit if needed. This will be prepopulated according to your organization details that you added while creating an account.

**6.** In the **Form Settings** section, choose the **opt-in** method for your audience. As an Engage user, donot tickmark the **Enable double opt-in** option, rather prefer the other one.

**7.** In the **Notifications** section, review the email address that you'd like to receive notifications about your audience, and edit if needed. Click **Save**. As soon as your audience gets created, you will be able to import contacts within it from Engage. 

Now, generate an API key for your audience in order to connect Mailchimp with Engage.

You will only be able to see the full API key immediately after you generate it. After that, you will only see the name given to it and its first 4 digits.

**1.** Click your profile icon and choose **Profile**.

**4.** **Name** your key. Be descriptive, so you know what app uses that key and click **Generate Key**.

**5.** Once we generate your key, click **Copy Key to Clipboard**. Save your key someplace secure as you won't be able to see or copy it again. If you lose this key, youâ€™ll need to generate a new key and update any integration that uses it. Click **Done**.

1. First and last name
2. Email address
3. Status
