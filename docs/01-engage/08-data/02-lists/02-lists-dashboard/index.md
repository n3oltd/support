## Folder Structure for Lists

Lists in Engage, are now created and placed within a **folder structure** on the dashboard. A folder structure reduces clutter and provides an opportunity to display different resources in one place. The lists dashboard shows two types of predefined folders for each user:

1. **My list folder:** Contains all those lists that are for the user only.
2. **Shared list folder:** Contains all those lists that are shared within the organization or everyone.

Each list created under these folders can be seen in the form of a table with the following parameters.

| Lists Parameters | Description |
| ---------------- | ----------- |
| **Reference** | Reference number of the list created. |
| **Name** | Name of the list. |
| **Type** | Type of list created e.g. *accounts*, *beneficiaries* or *payments* list. |
| **Created by** | Name of the user who created the list. |
| **Size** | Number of records in a single list. |
| **Last Refreshed** | The date and time when a list was last refreshed. |
| **Status** | Status of a list as *active* or *not active*.  |

:::info
You can also use filters on parameters, like *Type*, to view a list of a certain type.
