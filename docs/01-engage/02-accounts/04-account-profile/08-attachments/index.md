In charity funding, an attachment may refer to a digital file, such as a document, image etc. that is added or included along with a donation or funding submission to a charity organization. 

Attachments can be relevant in many cases like:

- **Smooth Communication:** Uploading attachments electronically streamlines the communication and application process as donors can conveniently submit all required documents in one go.

- **Faster Evaluation:** Having all necessary information and supporting documents available in the form of attachments enables quicker responses on funding applications.

- **Document Security:** Uploading attachments through secure online platforms or email attachments helps protect sensitive information and maintains data security.
