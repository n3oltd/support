A profile page is a section or webpage that provides information about an individual or entity. It serves as a summary or snapshot of someone's identity, background, or characteristics. Profile pages are commonly found on social media platforms, professional networking websites, and other online platforms including charity funding.

In Engage, whenever a user makes an account, their profile is made on the basis of the information they added. This profile is managed solely by the account user themselves and contains several parts including:

- Quick Insights
- Name
- Address
- Contact Information
- Online Presence
- Contact Preferences
- Gift Aid
- Tasks Bar

Each of these sections can be edited, updated and synced at the same time according to the need.  

## Quick Insights

The **quick insights** section gives information about:

1. The *average donations* total that the account owner has made and the date plus time for the *last* donation made. 
2. The frequency of making donations and the total number of *one-off donations* made per year.
3. The total *amount* of donations made.
4. A pie chart depicting the *location* (where most donations are needed) and *theme* (purpose of donation needed).
