## Viewing each Feedback in Detail

You can view each feedback created by clicking on its *reference number*. Each feedback in detail includes:

- Date and name of person who created the feedback
- Status of payment as *completed* or *awaiting*. 
- Details section including the feedback scheme name, location and theme etc.
- Specific reports and ledger section. 
- History of all the actions made on the feedback, via *View Log*. This option opens up a side panel indicating a timeline of all the events/actions that were made by the account along with the dates and description.

You can move a certain feedback to a different or anonymous account, cancel if the feedback is in awaiting payment status, or delete through the **three(...) dots** in the top corner of the page.
