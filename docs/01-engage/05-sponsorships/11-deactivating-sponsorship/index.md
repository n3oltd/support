title: Deactivating Sponsorships
sidebar_position: 11

Sponsorship deactivation typically refers to the process of discontinuing or ending a sponsorship arrangement between an individual/organization and a beneficiary. This is primarily used when the organization wants to remove the beneficiary entirely from a pool of available beneficiaries.

Engage allows you to deactivate a sponsorship for any beneficiary through **Engage Forms**, specifically designed for users to create and manage forms on the website. When deactivated, a beneficiary will not be able to be published or sponsored. This is different from unpublishing a beneficiary which means they are temporarily unavailable, but can be published by the organization relatively easily for re-sponsoring.

:::note
- For any changes saved and published in Engage Forms, Engage automatically syncs and pulls the updated information.       
- For a deactivated beneficiary having an active sponsorship at the moment, Engage automatically assigns a new beneficiary to that specific sponsorship.

## Approve the Deactivated Beneficiary 

As a default, following the above process will not complete the deactivation process. Instead, beneficaries submitted for deactivation will be sent to a queue to be approved by the head office.  

To access this queue and approve the deactivation, please see the following steps:

1. Under the **Sponsorships** content tab, select any **program** and then **scheme**.

2. In the top right corner, click **Dashboard** and then the **Deactivations** tab.

3. You will see a list of all the beneficiaries submitted for deactivation. Click the **down arrow** under the **Action** tab and select **Approve** for any beneficiary.

4. A prompt to approve as **yes** or **no** will appear. Select **yes**, and the request will be approved.
