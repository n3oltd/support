In Engage, an account, whether individual or organization, can create a sponsorship to sponsor a beneficiary in support of any cause. The first step to creating a sponsorship is landing on the **Create Sponsorship** screen. Either use method 1 or 2 and start creating.

:::note
- By default a sponsorship is created as anonymous. To associate the sponsorship with an account, click **Change Account** and choose the account accordingly.
- You can also visit an accounts profile menu, click **Sponsorships** and then **Add New Sponsorship** to create a sponsorship for that particular account.

## Method 1: Create a Sponsorship using Create
