Extending a sponsorship involves the continuation of financial support from a donor/sponsor to a beneficiary beyond the initial agreed-upon sponsorship period. This extension can happen for various reasons, such as continue supporting a cause, positive outcomes from the sponsorship, or a wish to maintain a beneficial relationship.
