**Crowdfunding** is a method of raising funds by collecting small contributions from a large number of people, typically via online platforms. For nonprofits, this approach is especially beneficial as it allows them to reach a broad audience beyond traditional fundraising circles. Crowdfunding campaigns can support specific projects, emergency relief efforts, ongoing programs, or even general operational expenses.

This document serves as a comprehensive guide for nonprofit organizations leveraging crowdfunding as a fundraising tool.

## Goals & Objectives of Crowdfunding Campaigns

1. **Raise Funds:** Generate financial support for projects, operational costs, or emergency initiatives.

2. **Increase Awareness:** Spread the word about the nonprofitâ€™s mission and cause to a wider audience.

3. **Engage New Donors:** Attract first-time donors and cultivate long-term relationships.

4. **Build a Community:** Foster a sense of belonging and shared purpose among supporters.

## How Does Crowdfunding Support Charities?

Crowdfunding allows charities to diversify their revenue streams beyond traditional grants, corporate donations, and major donor gifts. It helps organizations mobilize grassroots supporters, secure funding quickly for urgent needs, and leverage the power of storytelling to create emotional connections with donors.

**Donation-Based crowdfunding** allows donors to donate without expecting anything in return. This is ideal for emergency relief, medical aid, or community projects.
